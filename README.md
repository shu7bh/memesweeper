#memesweeper

The master of this repository is a fork from PlanteChili's memesweeper game. The game made by the us is in the Developer branch. To play the game, first you have to select the mode: Small, Medium, or Large, with the difficulty increasing in the same order.

The game is played with the help of a mouse. To select a cell, left-click on it. To flag a square, right-click on it. The game ends when you have uncovered all the tiles with numbers.

Any bomb tile if uncovered by the player will make the player instantaneously lose the game.

Cheers! Happy Playing

For any improvements or critical feedback, I will be happy to take it in consideration.
